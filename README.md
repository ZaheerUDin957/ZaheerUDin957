## <span style="color:#FF4500">🛠️ Professional Summary</span>

I have 1.5+ years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer with 4 months of AI training, 6+ months of internships in multiple software development firms, and 1+ year of teaching and research on advanced image processing and artificial intelligence in an academic institute. I am keenly interested in applying machine learning and deep learning models to develop efficient systems for research and development.

My expertise extends to working with generative AI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Gemini, OpenAI, and Hugging Face to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and chatbots. I bring excellent communication skills and hands-on experience in building and deploying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, and creating interactive dashboards with compelling narratives.
